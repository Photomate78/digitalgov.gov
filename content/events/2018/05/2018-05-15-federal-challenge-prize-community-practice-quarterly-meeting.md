Our quarterly Challenges and Prizes meeting brings together federal employees across government to discuss trends, success stories and lessons learned in the use of crowdsourcing competitions.

In this meeting, participants will:

- Hear about a current White House initiative with cross-government participation
- Discover how to set realistic goals and parameters for a successful hackathon
- Learn how to detect hidden barriers to participation in your agency’s competitions
- Get a first look at plans for this year’s reporting on challenges to Congress
- And more!

## Who Should Attend  

Members of the Federal Challenges & Prizes Community of Practice, program managers, contracting and procurement staff, communications teams, legal staff, and other federal employees who manage or work on crowdsourcing, challenge, and incentivized prize competitions, and other open innovation practices. We also welcome our colleagues from the citizen science and ideation communities of practice to join us for the training and networking.


## About the Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice

Our members support and encourage the use of incentivized competitions and challenges to attract and engage the public to meet critical government needs. The community gathers four times a year to share ideas, review best practices, and discuss policies and procedures. Membership and participation is open to federal, state, and local government.
