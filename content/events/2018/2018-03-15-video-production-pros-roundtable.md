Do you want to get more involved in the video industry within the federal government and learn from the best? Join the Video Production Community for our first meeting to discuss the future of the community and how you can get involved. We’d like to get your feedback about the needs of the community around trends, best practices, techniques/tools and strategies to build resources and training. This will help us plan for potential workshops, events, and networking opportunities in 2018.

We’ll also showcase and share video projects from various government agencies and provide background about their experiences. 
 
There will also be an opportunity for networking after the meeting.
