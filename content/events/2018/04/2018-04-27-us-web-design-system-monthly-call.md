Join us on Friday, April 27 at 10am PT / 1pm ET for our monthly conversation with fellow designers and developers across the government. This month, the U.S. Web Design System team will talk with a team from the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) about a library of forms that they've been creating as part of their work with the Veterans Affairs. This event will be held over Zoom.
